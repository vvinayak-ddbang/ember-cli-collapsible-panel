# Ember-cli-collapsible-panel

This is a replica of the Ember-collapsible-panel, Developed by [TedConf](https://github.com/tedconf/ember-collapsible-panel).
The Interactive demo for the original component is Available at: 
[Interactive documentation](http://tedconf.github.io/ember-collapsible-panel/)

Modification:
The original component uses an {{#if}} block and removes the panel body whenever the panel is collapsed.
Modifying this behaviour, by taking in a parameter 'hidePanel' {Boolean}, to add a feature to just hide the panel body instead of removing it from the DOM

## Installation

```
ember install ember-cli-collapsible-panel
```
